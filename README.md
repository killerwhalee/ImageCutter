ImageCutter
Developed by `CHAEMIN LIM`

## Introduction

ImageCutter is developed to cut KICE problem set pdf file into smaller part we want to. It cut pdf file into unit of problem.

## How to use ImageCutter?

You can easily select problem pdf file you want to cut by using file explorer provided by ImageCutter.

Everything would work well within program.

## Future goals

Unfortunately, not every form of test pdf is available. Only brand-new template of KICE and several private template are available.

Future goal is to change cutting alrogithm to make program automately "recognize" cutting range.

And I think this can be developed soon.
